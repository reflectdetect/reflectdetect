## Overview

Welcome to the official repository for the paper, "Application Note: An automated workflow for in-flight radiometric
calibration of UAV imagery".

<!-- TODO: Properly cite paper -->

### Abstract

> UAVs equipped with optical sensors have transformed remote sensing in vegetation science
> by providing high-resolution, on-demand data, enhancing studies in forestry,
> agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
> However, accurate radiometric calibration of UAV imagery remains challenging due to environmental variability
> and the limitations of existing methods, such as the common single gray reference panel, which is prone to errors.
> ReflectDetect, an open-source tool, addresses these challenges
> by automating radiometric calibration using geotagging and AprilTag detection.
> This dual-module approach ensures reliable calibration under varying conditions, reduces human error, and increases
> efficiency through a user-friendly CLI.
> ReflectDetect's modular design supports future enhancements and broader applicability across research fields.

<!-- TODO: Add images -->

> [!NOTE]
> We provide two workflows. For a detailed look at the technical details make
> sure to follow the upcoming `setup` and `usage` sections for your preferred workflow.

### :artificial_satellite: Workflow 1: Geolocation-Based Calibration

1. **Panel Reflectance Data**: Gather reflectance values of the panels for the bands you will capture images in, either
   from the manufacturer (for commercial panels) or using a field spectrometer (for DIY panels). Save these values in
   a `panel_properties.json` file.
2. **Field Setup**: Position the calibration panels in the field.
3. **Panel Location Data**: Capture the exact locations of the panel corners (we used a [Device Name](#) in our testing)
   and save them in a `panel_locations.gpkg` file.
4. **Image Capture**: Fly your drone mission, capturing images.
5. **Image Processing**: Convert the captured images to orthophotos by rectifying and geo-referencing them (we
   used [Software Name](#) in our testing).
6. **Run ReflectDetect**: Use ReflectDetect to convert the orthophotos to reflectance data.

### :white_square_button: Workflow 2: AprilTag-Based Calibration

1. **Panel Reflectance Data**: Gather reflectance values of the panels for the bands you will capture images in, either
   from the manufacturer (for commercial panels) or using a field spectrometer (for DIY panels). Save these values in
   a `panel_properties.json` file.
2. **Print AprilTags**: Print an AprilTag for each panel. PDF files for printing are available in
   the `/apriltag_printouts/` directory of this repository.
   <!-- [TODO: Add PDF files] -->
3. **Field Setup**: Position the calibration panels and place the AprilTags according to the placement guide.
4. **Image Capture**: Fly your drone mission, capturing images.
5. **Run ReflectDetect**: Use ReflectDetect to convert the images to reflectance data.

### Key Concepts and Vocabulary

- **Panel**: Calibration sheets placed in the field, used to compare captured intensity values in images with known
  reflectance values in the `panel_properties.json` file.

- **AprilTag / Tag**: A visual marker used for accurate detection in images.

- **Field**: The area captured by drone imagery.

- **Image**: Individual bands of captured data. ReflectDetect assumes all images were taken at equal time intervals and
  named in the format `*_{band_index}.tif`.  
  For example, `IMG_0052_6.tif` indicates the 6th band.

- **Orthophoto / Photo**: An image where all bands are combined and geo-referenced.

## Create a panel_properties.json file

To access the information about your calibration panels, we need you to create a `panel_properties.json` file. It
includes the reflectance values of each panel for each of the bands you captured.
In the following example we show how two panels might be configured. All the information about the first panel is
between the first `{ }` and so on.

The layer name corresponds to the name of the layer the coordinates of the panel corners are stored in, in the
`panel_locations.gpkg` file

```json
{
  "default_panel_width": 1.3,
  "default_panel_height": 1.3,
  "panel_properties": [
    {
      "layer_name": "corner_27",
      "bands": [
        0.9,
        1.0,
        1.0,
        1.0,
        0.72,
        0.91
      ]
    },
    {
      "layer_name": "corner_28",
      "bands": [
        0.9,
        1.0,
        0.43,
        0.70,
        0.35,
        0.4
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````

## Create dataset folder

In order for reflect-detect to be able to gather the necessary information about the images, panels, camera, etc. ,
reflect-detect expects you to structure your data in the following format:

```
dataset_folder
â   panels_properties.json
â   panel_locations.gpkg
â
ââââorthophotos
â   â   IMG_0000.tif
â   â   IMG_0001.tif
â   â   IMG_0002.tif
â   â   IMG_0003.tif
|   |   ...
```

# :artificial_satellite: Usage

After preparing the dataset folder, you are ready to run reflectdetect.
Open a command line or terminal.

To print the available arguments, run `reflectdetect-geolocation --help`

Assuming:

- the prepared dataset folder is at `C:\Users\username\Desktop\dataset_folder`
- the `panel_properties.json` and `panel_locations.gpkg` files and the `images` folder are in the dataset folder and correctly named

## Minimal example:

To start the program, open your terminal or command line and run

```bash
cd C:\Users\username\Desktop\dataset_folder
```

then

```bash
reflectdetect-geolocation
```

Alternatively you can run the program from anywhere using

```bash
reflectdetect-geolocation "C:\Users\username\Desktop\dataset_folder"
```

## Create a panel_properties.json file

To give access to the information about your calibration panels, create a `panel_properties.json` file. It
includes the reflectance values of each panel for each of the bands you captured.
The following examples show how two panels might be configured. All the information about the first panel is
between the first `{ }` and so on.

### Minimal Example

```json
{
  "default_panel_width": 1.3,
  "default_panel_height": 1.3,
  "panel_properties": [
    {
      "tag_id": 1,
      "bands": [
        0.9,
        1.0,
        1.0,
        1.0,
        0.72,
        0.91
      ]
    },
    {
      "tag_id": 2,
      "bands": [
        0.9,
        1.0,
        0.43,
        0.70,
        0.35,
        0.4
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Customizing the parameters

The first panel will use the default values, while the second panel specifies some of its own parameters.
Only `default_panel_width` and `default_panel_height` are required, the other parameters will have the default values as
below if not specified.
The tag id has to correspond to the id of the apriltag you placed next to the given panel. No id can be used twice!

```json
{
  "default_panel_width": 1.3,
  "default_panel_height": 1.3,
  "default_tag_family": "tag25h9",
  "default_tag_direction": "up",
  "default_panel_smudge_factor": 0.8,
  "default_tag_smudge_factor": 1.0,
  "default_shrink_factor": 0.8,
  "panel_properties": [
    {
      "tag_id": 1,
      "bands": [
        0.9,
        1.0,
        1.0,
        1.0,
        0.72,
        0.91
      ]
    },
    {
      "tag_id": 2,
      "panel_width": 2.0,
      "shrink_factor": 0.5,
      "bands": [
        0.9,
        1.0,
        0.43,
        0.70,
        0.35,
        0.4
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> The default parameters can also be overwritten using CLI arguments
>
> Run ```reflectdetect-apriltag -h``` to get a list
